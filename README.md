# EC601-WebRTC-Security-Analysis

EC601 Term Project- Analysis of OpenVidu and other WebRTC Applications

## Introduction

The WebRTC is one of the most popular real-time communication framework which can build on top of your browser. Unlike the old day, we have developed a lot of advanced technology to prevent data leak in the data communication. For example, the WebRTC do not need any plug-in application to run a virtual meeting on your browser, which lower the risk from security issue. Especially in the pandemic, we hold a lot of important meeting online. The security of our communication is crucial for everyone. In this case, we are trying to create our own communication portal using Openvido framework locally and hopefully we can set up an AWS server to run it. Also, we will analyze the data packet traffic to see if we can find a security weakness in our platform. On the other hand, we want to examine the vulnerability of peer-to-peer communication, however, the Openvido doesn't support that for now, so we will use another simple WebRTC example to see if we can build a peer-to-peer communication software and anaylze the vulnerability.

## Technical Approach - Brian

How are we doing it? What softwares are we going to use?

## MVP + User Story

The MVP for our product should be able to hold a virtual meeting with audio and video. 
Our user is anyone who need to hold meeting or attend meeting but unable to do so physically.
The user story is, for example, a professor in college do the lecture online and all of his/her students are attending this meeting at the same time with audio and video connection.
